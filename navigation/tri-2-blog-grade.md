                <h3> 5 Accomplishments </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/5_accomplishments.png"> 
                <p> I believe that I deserve 5 points on my five big accomplishments. Early on in the trimester I was able to get my static data stored on a backend api to show up on frontend and helped the rest of my group get to that point as well. Similarly, for the database I was the first member of my group to have all of my CRUD actions working and assisted my group members fromt there. As the deployment admin for my group, I was in charge of getting our deployed website working as well as updating the deployed backend whenever necessary and using the cockpit terminal to determine whether or not changes were actually being made to the deployed backend database. Finally, on our frontend I created a UI for performing all of the actions of CRUD and iterated through different designs for it to arrive at one that is clean and easy to use.</p>
                <h3> Full Stack Demo, CPT Requirements, and N@tM Feedback </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/feedback.png"> 
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/N@tM.png"> 
                <p> I believe that I deserve 1.8 points on the full stack demo, CPT requirements, and N@tM Feedback. My demo had a fully working about page with frontend to deployed backend connection using a PythonURI to still work locally if necessary. As shown above, my code meets all of the CPT requirements. As a group we recieved good feedback from N@tM from several different viewers. While we have not yet had the time to implement all of these changes, we have begun work on making improvements to mostly the design of our project off of the given feedback.</p>
                <h3> Project Feature Blog Writeup </h3>
                <p> I believe that I deserve 1 point on this blog write-up as I have included descriptive comments on everything that I have done throughout the trimester with images to supplement it in an organized fashion.</p>
                <h3> MCQ </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/college_board.png"> 
                <p> I believe that I deserve 1 point on the collegeboard MCQ. I tried my best on this MCQ and believe I got a very good score. I also went through all of the questions that I got wrong and gave an explanation for why they were wrong above.</p>
                <h3> 10th Point </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/otherN@tM.png"> 
                <p> For this 10th point, I believe that I deserve 0.5. During N@tM I went around and looked at another CSP project, a CSA project, and even a CSSE project giving advice to each on ways that I believe they could improve their projects. I also believe this is an area in which my continous effort to help the rest of my group members get all of their features working should be recognized. I think that one of my strengths that has developed through this CompSci class is developing an understanding of how the code actually works. I've seen a lot of people in this class either copy code or simply ask ChatGPT any time anything doesn't work exactly right, but I've made an effort to try to understand where the issue is coming from and problem solve on my own which has allowed me to fix other issues that my groupmates come to me with.</p>
                <h3> Total </h3>
                <p> In total, my self-grade brings me to a 9.3/10 which I believe is reasonable for the growth I have shown over this trimester and what I have been able to accomplish. </p>
