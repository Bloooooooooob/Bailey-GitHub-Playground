<b> Sprint 1 </b>
In sprint 1 we played around with a github website learning how to add pages and jupyter notebooks to our repositories.
I found this sprint to be helpful in developing my skills with github and website creation, something I had very little experience with before this class.

<b> Sprint 2 </b>
In sprint 2 we learned about one of the fundamentals of coding under the big idea 3 section and then taught a lesson on it to the class.
My group was assigned 3.3 and 3.5, which were about mathematical expressions and booleans.
Not only did I learn about these two, but through the lessons taught by the other people in the class I was able to learn about all of the other fundamentals including loops, sets, dictionaries, if statements, and more.
