<b> Sprint 1 </b>
In sprint 1 we played around with a github website learning how to add pages and jupyter notebooks to our repositories.
I found this sprint to be helpful in developing my skills with github and website creation, something I had very little experience with before this class.

<b> Sprint 2 </b>
In sprint 2 we learned about one of the fundamentals of coding under the big idea 3 section and then taught a lesson on it to the class.
My group was assigned 3.3 and 3.5, which were about mathematical expressions and booleans.
Not only did I learn about these two, but through the lessons taught by the other people in the class I was able to learn about all of the other fundamentals including loops, sets, dictionaries, if statements, and more.

<b>Personal Reflection</b>

a. This is why I know my units

I know my units because I was paying attention through all of the lessons and did the homework and popcorn hacks thoroughly.  

b. This is how I build a summary in my blog that show how I know or how I will review

I can create summaries like this that show what I learned in the last sprint and how I can improve upon my work and work ethic in future sprints

c. This is how you know I am more than be perfunctory on my learning journey

I'm serious about my learning and I want to learn for the sake of becoming a better coder rather than learning the content solely for the grade. I think that coding is such a cool skill that I want to enhance more for the sake of having a wider range of knowledge beyond what I currently possess. 

d. Here are some memories from my homework, learning, and teaching

I really enjoyed teaching the class and learning from all of the other lessons. I feel like the small basis of understanding of coding concepts that I had has been advanced significantly and I remember several times where I learned a new thing that I want to make use of in a future coding projects. For instance, there were several shortcuts using lists, tuples, and sets that I never would have known on my own, and I likely would have used much longer and more convoluted methods of creating the same result.

e. This is how you know my work is distinctive, unique and genuine

I add my own style and make sure that I'm never exactly copying something and any time I do take inspiration I make sure to add something else to it to make it my own.
