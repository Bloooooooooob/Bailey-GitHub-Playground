ðŸ’» Hi, I'm Bailey Leeder. I am a junior at Del Norte High School in the AP Computer Science Principles class, and I am creating this website as a first dive into computer science.

<h1>Some things I love to do</h1>

ðŸŽ­  I love theatre and improv. I'm a captain of the Del Norte Improv Team this year and I've been in all of the theatre shows since my freshman year. 

ðŸ§ª I also really love math and chemistry.
