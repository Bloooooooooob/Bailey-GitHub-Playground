💻 Hi, I'm Bailey Leeder. I am a junior at Del Norte High School in the AP Computer Science Principles class, and I am creating this website as a first dive into computer science.

<h2>Some things I love to do</h2>


🎭  I love theatre and improv. I'm a captain of the Del Norte Improv Team this year and I've been in all of the theatre shows since my freshman year. 

🧪 I also really love math and chemistry.
