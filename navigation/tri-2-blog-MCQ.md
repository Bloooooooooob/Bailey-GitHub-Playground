            <h2>Collegeboard MCQ</h2>

                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/college_board.png"> 
                <p> Overall I feel pretty good about how I did on this MC. I got 59/67 which is an 88%. There were definitely a few questions I feel like I need more help with.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3> 2.1 </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/2.1(1).png"> 
                <p> I put light yellow as the answer when it was actually ivory. Both have 255 or red and green, the only difference is the value of blue. Light yellow has a smaller blue value than ivory. Since the given binary has four 0s at the end of the blue value we can take 255 and subtract 1, 2, 4, and 8. In essense we are doing 255 - 15 which gives 240, the blue value for ivory.</p>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/2.1(2).png"> 
                <p> For this question, all digital data at its most broken down level is encoded with binary or bits meaning that all three of these, an integer, an alphanumeric character, and even a machine learning instruction can be represented with a series of bits.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h3> 3.11 </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/3.11.png"> 
                <p> I put the target being -1 as something that would cause the procedure to work incorrectly. This is not true as it will still output correctly it will just be -1 either way. The true answer is that the values have to be in sorted order as this is a requirement for a binary search.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h3> 3.17 </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/3.17.png"> 
                <p> Reasonable time is anything that runs within a polynomial function of the number of values. This means that 10, 2n, and n squared all run in reasonable time so all three are correct answers.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h3> 4.1 </h3>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/4.1(1).png"> 
                <p> While two of my answers were correct, answer 1 was not since the internet has no central device controlling it.</p>
                <img src="/Bailey-GitHub-Playground//images/4.1(2).png"> 
                <p> IP and TCP are designed to set a standard format for sending messages across the internet and are not designed to be completely secure.</p>
            </div>
            <h3> 5.5 </h3>
